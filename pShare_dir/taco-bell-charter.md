# Team Charter Template
Last updated: [2024-10-02]

## Team Name: Taco Bell

### Team Members:
- James Xu
- Mazen Saadi
- William Mai
- Joshua Sherwood

## 1. Project Objectives
Our objective is to design a hybrid storage architecture that allows users to store and access files across chosen devices instead of trusting a 3rd-party cloud service. It will involve aspects of P2P and Client-server architecture, and include security during data transfer, redundancy through RAID, scalability, and efficiency through network and storage optimization algorithms.

### 1.1 Specific Goals
Go: networking
Python: scripts for encryption and other things
Electron/JavaScript/HTML: design UI, connect to backend

Docker: Currently reviewing if we should use it
	-Pros: 
		-Ensures that all of us can run the application in the same environment, thus issues dependent on different OS, software versions, or dependences are resolved
		- Also makes it easier to deploy project on any machine w/ Docker installed (i.e. local development, testing, or submitting final project) 
	- Cons: Introducing Docker to our project also introduces a learning curve, we'd need to take some time to learn how to effectively use it
		



## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

James Xu: Control file distribution
Mazen Saadi: File splitting, UI, integration
William Mai: Integration/design, networking
Joshua Sherwood: Networking, algorithm optimization
Whole Group: Integrating the different components (file splitting & distribution, networking, UI)



### 2.1 Team Lead

### 2.3 Logistics

- Each person is responsible for updating the weekly status for what they contributed as the sprint progresses
	- The responsibility for creating/updating tickets is going to be shared between all group members 
	- Debugging, testing, troubleshooting, and developing are all going to be considered a team effort


## 3. Communication Guidelines

### 3.1 Communication Tools
- We will use Slack for async communication between team members, mentors, and instructors
- We will use Zoom for weekly meetings with instructors and mentors
- We will use GitHub projects to track sprint progress and post weekly updates


### 3.2 Meetings
- Weekly meetings with the team mentor will be held Fridays at 3:45pm over Zoom.
- Weekly meetings with the instructor will be held Mondays at 3pm over Zoom
- Weekly group meetings will take place on Wednesday's at 5pm

### 3.3 Documentation & Reporting
- Meeting notes will be documented and shared over Slack within 24 hours of each meeting.
- Team members will post weekly status updates to github projects no later than Wednesday night outlining:
	- what they worked on over the past week
	- if they are blocked on anything
	- what they are currently working on
- All members will be given equal opportunity to participate in discussion and be open to listening to diverse perspectives on all topics/ideas.
- All members must be transparent about their progress, challenges, and any delays they anticipate.

## 4. Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus-Based Decisions**: Major decisions will be made through consensus among all team members. If no majority is reached, the team will reach out to their mentor and instructor for guidance.
- **Documentation**: All decisions must be documented and shared with the team to ensure clarity and alignment.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Any conflicts between team members should first be addressed internally through open communication. If unresolved, members must notify the instructor who will then mediate.

## 5. Performance Standards

### 5.1 Work Distribution
- **Flexibility**: If a member is unable to complete a task, they must notify the team as soon as possible to allow for reallocation or assistance.

### 5.2 Respect and Professionalism
- **Mutual Respect**: All members are expected to treat each other with respect and professionalism.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Feedback should be given and received constructively, focusing on improving the project.

## 6. Resource Allocation
- **Time Commitment**: All members are expected to spend ~10 hours of time outside of class per week on the project.
- **Workload Distribution**: Tasks will be assigned based on each member's expertise and availability. Each member is expected to complete their assigned tasks within the agreed-upon deadlines. 
- **Shared Resources:** We will share connections to each other's computers as our project is heavily involved with networking.
